Here is the updated Contour language syntax, incorporating elements for Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, strong static typing, AI-assisted optimization, and predictable performance:

⸻

1. Basic Constructs
	•	Variables & Types: All variables are strongly typed. Explicit type annotations are required.

# Define a variable with type annotations
let myVar: Integer = 10;

# Arrays and collections
let myArray: Array[Integer] = [1, 2, 3];
let myMap: Map[String, Integer] = {"one": 1, "two": 2};

# Define constants
const PI: Float = 3.14159;



⸻

2. Functions and Methods
	•	Function Definition: Functions can be defined with or without return types. Functions are first-class objects.

# Function with return type
def add(x: Integer, y: Integer) -> Integer {
  return x + y;
}

# Function without return type (void)
def logMessage(msg: String) {
  print(msg);
}

# Function with multiple parameters and complex logic
def fetchData(url: String, headers: Map[String, String]) -> Data {
  encrypt(url);
  fetch(url);
  decrypt(url);
  return Data;
}



⸻

3. Control Flow
	•	Conditionals: If-Else and Match (for pattern matching).

# If-Else
if x > 10 {
  log("Greater than 10");
} else {
  log("Less than or equal to 10");
}

# Match (Pattern Matching)
match x {
  case 1 -> log("One");
  case 2 -> log("Two");
  case _ -> log("Other");
}



⸻

4. Loops & Iterations
	•	For Loops: Traditional and enhanced loops.

# For-Loop with range
for i in 0..10 {
  print(i);
}

# While Loop
while condition {
  // Repeat until condition becomes false
  processData();
}



⸻

5. Collections & Iterators
	•	Maps, Arrays, Sets, etc.: Collection types with built-in iteration.

# Iterating over an array
for elem in myArray {
  log(elem);
}

# Iterating over a map
for (key, value) in myMap {
  log(key + ": " + value);
}

# Map Transformation
myArray.map(x -> x * 2);



⸻

6. Data Streams and Asynchronous Constructs
	•	Data Streams: Functions and operations designed to handle data streams efficiently.

# Streaming data with processing
stream getData(@source: String) -> StreamData {
  encrypt(@source);
  retrieve(@source);
  decrypt(@source);
  return StreamData;
}

# Process Stream with async/await pattern
def processStream(input: StreamData, handler: Handler) {
  apply(input, handler);
  track(input);
}

# Repeat streaming until condition is met
repeat until streamComplete {
  processStream(getData("someEndpoint"), processHandler);
  transmitOutput(streamComplete);
}



⸻

7. Memory & Resource Management
	•	Static Memory Allocation: Strong typing for memory management.

# Static Memory Allocation for arrays
let buffer: Array[Byte] = allocate(1024);

# Explicit memory management
let ptr: Pointer[Integer] = allocateMemory(256);
deallocateMemory(ptr);

	•	Automatic Resource Management: Simplified resource handling with automatic garbage collection and memory deallocation.

autoMemoryManagement enable;



⸻

8. Optimization Constructs
	•	Inlined Functions: Functions that are optimized by the AOT compiler through inlining.

# Function that should be inlined during compilation
inline def square(x: Integer) -> Integer {
  return x * x;
}

# Function call will be replaced by the body of the function at compile-time
let result = square(5);

	•	Constant Folding: Evaluates constant expressions during compilation.

# Constant folding example
const result = 5 * 3 + 2;  # The compiler will calculate this during AOT

	•	Loop Unrolling: The AOT compiler can unroll loops to improve performance.

# Example loop that can be unrolled
for i in 0..10 {
  process(i);
}



⸻

9. Error Handling and Logging
	•	Error Handling: Error handling is done with strict type checking, and logs are automatically generated for tracking.

# Try-Catch for error handling
try {
  performRiskyOperation();
} catch (e: Exception) {
  log("Error occurred: " + e.message);
}

# Log statements for tracing
log("Process completed successfully");



⸻

10. Types and Data Structures
	•	Custom Data Types: Support for user-defined types with complex structures.

# Custom Data Type (Record)
type Person {
  name: String;
  age: Integer;
  address: String;
}

# Creating instances
let person1 = Person(name="John", age=30, address="123 Main St");



⸻

11. Import & Export
	•	Modules and Libraries: External modules can be imported for functionality.

# Import external libraries
import Networking;
import Encryption;

# Use imported functions
let encryptedData = Encryption.encryptData(data);



⸻

12. Compilation Directives
	•	Static Optimizations & Directives: Specific compiler hints for optimization and compilation settings.

# Explicit compile-time optimizations
@optimizeInline
def fastFunction(x: Integer) -> Integer {
  return x * x;
}

# Compiler flag for AOT specific behavior
@AOTCompileOnly
def compileOnlyAtBuildTime() {
  // This function will only be considered during AOT compilation, not runtime
}



⸻

13. Concurrency and Parallelism
	•	Parallel Constructs: The AOT compiler can optimize for multi-threaded and parallel execution paths.

# Parallel execution
par for i in 0..10 {
  process(i);
}

# Asynchronous task execution
async def fetchDataAsync(url: String) -> Data {
  return fetchData(url);
}



⸻

14. AI-Enhanced Compilation
	•	AI-assisted Optimizations: AI-powered static analysis for optimization during AOT compilation.

# AI-Driven Optimization Hints
@optimizeUsingAI
def aiOptimizedFunction(data: Data) -> OptimizedResult {
  process(data);
  return OptimizedResult;
}



⸻

15. Static Debugging and Profiling
	•	Compile-Time Debugging: The language supports debugging during compilation to identify inefficiencies or potential bugs.

# Static Debugging
@debugAtCompileTime
def debugFunction(data: Data) -> DebugResult {
  // During compilation, the function will be analyzed for static errors
  return DebugResult;
}



⸻

16. Performance and Load Handling
	•	High-Performance Optimizations: Specific syntax allows the compiler to optimize high-performance code.

# High-performance loop for AOT optimization
inline par for i in 0..1000 {
  performHighSpeedOperation(i);
}



⸻

	•	Memory Management: Built-in constructs for memory management and optimization, preventing leaks or misuse.
	•	AI Integration: The compiler can be enhanced with AI to learn the best optimization patterns and improve compilation over time.
	•	Concurrency: Support for parallelism and multi-threaded execution during AOT compilation.

This language, optimized for AOT, ensures high performance and security, making it ideal for systems requiring efficiency and reliability. The AI-powered compiler will ensure the best optimizations are performed, making your code run faster, use less memory, and perform better in real-world environments.

Semantics of the Language:

1. Memory Semantics
	•	Static Memory Allocation: All variables, arrays, and data structures are allocated statically at compile time. This ensures predictable memory usage and optimized performance.

let buffer: Array[Byte] = allocate(1024);

	•	Pointers & Direct Memory Access: Pointers to specific memory regions are allowed. Explicit memory deallocation is required after usage to prevent memory leaks.

let ptr: Pointer[Integer] = allocateMemory(256);
deallocateMemory(ptr);

	•	Automatic Memory Management: For complex types (e.g., objects), memory management can be abstracted and managed automatically using a garbage collection mechanism at compile time, but only if explicitly specified.

autoMemoryManagement enable;

2. Type Semantics
	•	Strong Typing: Each variable or function must have an explicit type, which must be strictly adhered to throughout the program. Types are determined during AOT compilation.

let x: Integer = 10;  # Type Integer is statically enforced.

	•	Custom Data Types: New data types can be defined through records or types. These are evaluated at compile-time and tightly bound to their usage.

type Person {
  name: String;
  age: Integer;
  address: String;
}

	•	Type Inference: While the language is statically typed, some aspects may support limited type inference where it can deduce the type from context during compilation.

let result = add(10, 20);  # The type of `result` is inferred as Integer.

3. Performance Semantics
	•	Ahead-Of-Time Compilation: Every aspect of the code, from functions to data structures, is precompiled. This means there are no runtime surprises, and performance is predictable.

@AOTCompileOnly
def compileOnlyAtBuildTime() { ... }

	•	Compiler Hints: By providing specific compiler hints like @optimizeInline or @AIOptimize, developers can further guide the compiler to ensure maximum performance for critical parts of the code.

@optimizeInline
def fastFunction(x: Integer) -> Integer { ... }

This version of Contour provides a blend of strong static typing, predictable performance through AOT, and high-level optimizations powered by AI and AOT compilation. This approach maximizes both developer control and performance reliability.
